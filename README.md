Bootstrap Responsive Class Tester
=================================

This is a little nugget of HTML that shows which [Twitter Bootstrap responsive utility classes](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#responsive) are active at your current viewport size. It's intended to be a piece of [Liferay](http://www.liferay.com/) Web content you can just drop on a page and start testing with &ndash; mainly for the benefit of developers who may not be that familiar with the framework but want an easy way to leverage some of that responsive goodness. There's nothing Liferay-specific about it, though, so feel free to use it wherever you need it!

It's based on the [Alloy UI implementation](http://liferay.github.io/alloy-bootstrap/), which is forked from [Bootstrap v2.3](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/). The utility classes changed fairly significantly in [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/), so I'm afraid it won't work for you there. The meat of this snippet is lifted straight from the [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#responsive) *([CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/))* &ndash; thanks, guys, for all that you do!
